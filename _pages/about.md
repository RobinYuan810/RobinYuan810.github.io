Personal Introduction
======
I am a second-year master's student from the [Software Engineering Institute](http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/) at [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include trustworthy artificial intelligence, graph neural networks, and software engineering.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min Zhang](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/zm2/main.psp) of the Trusted AI Technology Laboratory at the [Dihu Lake International Software Institute](http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/) at East China Normal University.
